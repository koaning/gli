### Why is this called `gli`? 

I have _so_ many scripts and I wanted to start re-using them. 

So I made this repo. 

I am hoping it will spark glee on the command-line.

### Where can I visit it? 

The mkdocs page can be found on [https://koaning.github.io/gli/](https://koaning.github.io/gli/).

From there you can search through the scripts.

### What's in here? 

Most of these scripts are meant to be used together with [spaCy](https://spacy.io) 
and [Prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy). But there may be some general utils in here as well. 

### Can I copy stuff? 

Sure, go for it.

### Can I contribute? 

You're open to suggest a command line util to host here, but
my main intention is to keep this repo as a personal utility.
